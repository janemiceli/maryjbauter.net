Things I am doing Spring 2003 semester with my time include:  
being the President of <a href="http://www.ieeecs.soc.uwm.edu">IEEE-CS</a>, being the President
for the <a href="http://www.uwm.edu/StudentOrg/wb9jbf/">Amateur Radio Club</a>, getting confirmed at the  
Newman Center, volunteer service projects and getting together  
with my friends and family. I like to go to the Klotsche Center  
and work out when the time permits. Most of all, I really plan  
on sleeping more, when I get to it. 

I work as an I.T. Developer Intern at <a href="http://www.software.rockwell.com">Rockwell Software</a>.
I write test scripts and I am working hard on automating 
and testing all Rockwell Software's products. I get
to stay there until I graduate and work as many hours as
I can. The experience alone is worth it. I love this job!!!

I got confirmed at the Newman Center for the Easter Vigil on April 19th, 2003 
around 8:15pm (after the sunset). 
Here is the address: 
	Newman Center & Chapel - Catholic Campus Ministry UWM 
	3001 North Downer Avenue 
	Milwaukee, WI  53211 
It was wonderful

I know my friends have worried about my sleep deprivation over  
the years, so if you are reading this, don't worry anymore. I  
am taking a class called "Introduction to Leisure." For this  
class we have to have a minimum of 6 leisure "experiences" which
you get class time off for and napping is included as an experience. 
It's a nice 3 credit class to learn the importance of leisure.  
It also fills a humanities requirement at U.W.M.!! 
If you are looking to take it: HUMKIN-101. 

Here is my <a href="http://www.uwm.edu/~mjbauter/wishlist" TARGET=_self>Wishlist.</a>

Here are <a href=pics.html TARGET=_self>pictures</a> of people and places that are important to me.
